Each house is in the Metro Vancouver area or on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada.
All houses are powered by the provincial power utility BC Hydro (https://www.bchydro.com/).
Power generation is nearly 100% hydro-electric with large dams.
The majority of houses are heated by natural gas provided by FortisBC (https://www.fortisbc.com/).
Hourly energy data is downloaded directly by the customer from the BC Hydro website.
Customers login to there account, download the data, and donated it to this dataset for research.
Donated data is anonymized to protect the privacy of the donors.

First Reading:
    The first reading date in the house's data file.

Last Reading:
    The last reading date in the house's data file.
    At the end of each year, some house files will be updated with new data.

Cover (data coverage):
    The percent of non-missing readings. A value of 1.000 is 100%.

House Types:
    character   - multi-level houses build before 1940
    bungalow    - single-level (w/ basement) houses built in the 1940s and 1950s
    special     - two-level houses built between 1965 to 1989
    modern      - two-/three-level houses build in the 1990s and afterwards
    duplex      - two houses that share a common wall, can be side-by-side or front-back
    triplex     - three houses that share common walls: top unit, front unit, and back unit
    townhouse   - row houses that share one or two common walls
    apartment   - hight-rise or low-rise living units
    laneway     - small homes built in the backyard of the main house which open onto the back lane

Facing:
    What direction the house is facing.
    This often has an impact on house cooling durning the summer.
    East and West facing houses get hotter faster.

Region:
    The 3-letter code of the house's regional weather station.
        YVR - Vancouver and Lower Mainland area
        WYJ - Victoria and surrounding area

RUs (rentals units):
    The number of rental suites in the house. More rental suites means higher consumption.

EVs (electric vehicles):
    If there is an EV, what is the size of the battery (in kWh).

HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning):
    A description of the HVAC systems which also has an impact on power consumption.

    Here is the short codes legend:
        FAGF  - forced air gas furnace
        HP    - heat pump (incl. a/c)
        FPG   - gas fireplace
        FPE   - electric fireplace
        IFRHG - in-floor radiant heating (gas boiler)
        NAC   - no a/c
        FAC   - fixed a/c unit
        PAC   - portable a/c unit
        BHE   - baseboard heater (electric)
        IFRHE - in-floor radiant heating (electric)
        WRHIR - water radiant heat (cast iron radiators)
        GEOTH - geothermal

SN (special notes):
    (1) HVAC heat change over to gas at <= 2Â°C
    (1) Same house used in AMPds and RAE House 1 datasets
    (2) Same house used in RAE House 2 dataset
